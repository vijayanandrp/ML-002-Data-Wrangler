Database column values cleaning using supervised learning models - multi-label problem.


### Data wrangling
Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as **data munging**, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. A **data wrangler** is a person who performs these transformation operations. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling)

Wrangler is an interactive tool for data cleaning and transformation.
Spend less time formatting and more time analyzing your data. [stanford](http://vis.stanford.edu/wrangler/)
